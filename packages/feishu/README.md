# feishu/ — Feishu bot to DSH sessions

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The Feishu family connects a Feishu (Lark) bot to the harness: chat events arrive over an outbound WSS long connection or an inbound webhook route, each chat runs as one multi-turn root Session, and the assistant text each completed turn leaves in the session log is replied through the Feishu API.

## Packages

- [`feishu`](feishu/) — the bot plugin: ingress normalization, chat-to-Session routing, turn settlement, and the two transport edges.

- [Webhook runtime](../webhook/) — the fire-and-forget event family this plugin deliberately does not reuse
