English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-feishu` turns a Feishu (Lark) bot into a DSH front door. Each chat's main stream and topic threads map to their own multi-turn root Session; every admitted message becomes one follow-up turn, and the completed turn's assistant text is replied as plain text or one markdown card. Two transport edges carry events — an outbound WSS long connection needing no public URL, and an inbound webhook route on an optionally composed `dsh-host-webserver` — hot-swapped when the `feishu` settings section changes. Interactive cards answer in-turn approval and question requests, and the callback response refreshes the settled card.

## Configuration

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `transport` | `websocket` (default) or `webhook`. |
| `domain` | `feishu` (default), `lark`, or a self-hosted deployment's complete API origin (`https://…`). |
| `appIdEnv` / `appSecretEnv` | Credential references resolved per edge start; literals `appId`/`appSecret` win when set. |
| `verificationTokenEnv` / `encryptKeyEnv` | Webhook-only credential references (SDK dispatcher verification). |
| `path` / `maxBodyBytes` | Webhook route path (default `/feishu`) and body ceiling (default 65536). |
| `allowChatIds` | Chats the bot answers; empty (default) answers every chat that reaches it. |
| `groupRequireMention` | In groups, answer only mentioned messages (default `true`). |
| `replyInThread` | Open one topic per main-stream message and answer inside it (default `false`); topic messages always continue their topic, so each question keeps its own session. |
| `replyForm` / `cardTitle` | Reply form: `auto` (default; turns carrying workflow runs or approval asks reply as one markdown card, the rest as text), `text`, or `card` (always one markdown card); `cardTitle` is the card header title (default `DSH`). |
| `thinkingEmoji` | Emoji key bracketing each admitted turn as the thinking indicator (default `Typing`); empty disables the indicator. |
| `replyCharLimit` / `failureNotice` | Reply truncation bound (default 4000, shared by both forms) and the failure reply text. |
| `dedupCapacity` | Remembered message identities for retry deduplication (default 1024). |
| `cardLocale` | Builder multilingual key lifted to `elements`/`header` when a template card is a builder export (default `zh_cn`). |
| `interactionCards` | Interactive approval/question cards: `enabled` (default `false`), approval `deciderOpenIds`/`deciderUserIds` (parallel allowlists matched against the callback operator's `open_id`/`user_id`; either hit qualifies, and both empty by default leaves approval requests to other channels), approval `pendingCard` (local card JSON 1.0 frame with `{{toolName}}`/`{{reason}}`; the button row is appended) plus `approveLabel`/`rejectLabel`, question `title`/`submitLabel`, and per-kind settled style — exactly one of a local `settledCard` frame (`{{outcome}}`/`{{decidedBy}}`/`{{summary}}`) or a platform `settledTemplateId`. Card callbacks follow the console's delivery config: long-connection mode rides the websocket edge, and request-address mode needs the composed WebServer's `<path>/card` route. |
| `cardTemplates` | Registry of card templates for bound tool turns: name, `bindTool` (optional `workflowName` filter), exactly one of platform `templateId` or local `card` carrying `{{variable}}` placeholders, and per-variable extraction rules (a `context` key or a `tool-result` dot path, `required`, `maxLength`). A local card accepts canonical card JSON 1.0 or the builder's multilingual export (`i18n_elements`/`i18n_header`, lifted from `cardLocale`); card JSON 2.0 is rejected by name until a `'v2'` dialect ships. |
| `workspacePath` / `agentPreset` / `permissionPreset` | Deployment-only: the sessions' workspace, agent composition, and sandbox/approval preset. Never editable through settings. |

All fields except the last row form the `feishu` settings namespace (`installSection`), so the settings UI edits them live and a commit hot-swaps the transport edge.

## Transports

- **websocket** — the SDK client (`@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk`) dials out, so no public URL, TLS terminator, or challenge handshake is needed. Feishu requires single-connection semantics per app credential; run one DSH instance per app. A credential write re-runs the edge swap through the `credentials/reference-updated` event, so a rotated secret reconnects without a process restart.
- **webhook** — registers one exact route on the composed WebServer (resolved through an optional `ctx.inject` ref; a webhook section without a WebServer fails the settings `validate` hook and the edge start equally loud). Point a TLS reverse proxy at an isolated listener, as the [overlay example](../../../apps/cli/config/examples/feishu-bot/cordis.yml) shows.

<a id="interactive-cards"></a>
## Interactive cards

When a turn's tool call needs approval, or the model calls `ask_user_question`, the bridge (mounted on every chat agent's scoped world) answers the request with one card replied to the turn's anchor message: two buttons whose values carry the interaction identity for approvals, or one generated form — options project to a select (multi-select when several may be chosen), option-less questions to a text input — for questions. Callbacks reach the plugin through whichever ingress the Feishu console's card-callback delivery config selects — long-connection mode delivers `card.action.trigger` as one more event frame on the websocket edge (the handler's return value is relayed to the platform as the callback response), and request-address mode posts to the `<path>/card` route (verified through the SDK's card handler). Either ingress matches the returned identity back to the pending interaction, resolves the waterfall synchronously (Feishu requires the response within three seconds; the agent's continued turn runs on), and refreshes the card in the callback response itself: the settled card replaces the pending one in place, as a local JSON 1.0 document or a platform template. Without a composed WebServer only the long-connection mode is served, and the skip is logged.

Cards only claim requests of turns this channel is serving: an anchored turn answers with cards, a turn another channel drives passes through `next()`, so the Web UI keeps answering its own sessions. Approval cards settle only clicks that carry a verdict and whose operator matches the configured `deciderOpenIds` (by `open_id`) or `deciderUserIds` (by `user_id`, delivered only under the app's granted scope): a malformed or unqualified click answers with an error toast and leaves the pending interaction claimable by a later one, and with both decider lists empty the bridge claims no approval request at all — question forms stay answerable by the chat. An aborted request settles cancelled; its card cannot refresh without a callback, so a later click meets the already-settled toast. The event subscription and the card-callback delivery config are set independently in the Feishu console; a long-connection message transport pairs naturally with long-connection card callbacks, and request-address card callbacks work beside either message transport.

## Service API

- `sessionIdForChat(chatId)` — deterministic `feishu-<sha256(chatId)>` Session id; a restart resumes the persisted session under the same id with no side-car mapping.
- `sessionIdForThread(chatId, threadId)` — the same derivation hashing the chat and topic identities; one topic thread is one session beside the chat's main stream.
- `ConversationRouter` — dedup by message id, per-chat queueing, session create/resume (a live agent another channel published for the chat's session, e.g. the Web UI, is adopted instead of resumed), turn settlement from the session log, a best-effort thinking reaction bracketing each admitted turn, and — under `replyInThread` — one bot-opened topic per main-stream message answered in place of the main stream.
- `createTopicOpener` / `topicSummary` — the topic-opening reply (`reply_in_thread`, lead message carrying the single-lined question summary) and its pure summary projection.
- `matchCardTemplate` / `resolveTemplateVariables` / `resolveCardFormat` / `normalizeTemplateCard` / `renderTemplateReply` — the pure card-template pipeline: registry matching over the turn's tool calls, variable extraction from logged tool-result meta and message facts, dialect resolution (canonical 1.0 or builder multilingual export; card JSON 2.0 rejected by name), locale lifting onto the canonical send form, and platform-or-local payload rendering.
- `convertCardV2toV1` — the reserved projector for a future card JSON 2.0 input dialect: lifts `body.elements`, drops 2.0-only keys (keeping the `margin`/`horizontal_spacing` that 1.0 `column_set` carries), and gives bare `img` elements the `alt` 1.0 requires; nothing routes here until a `'v2'` dialect joins `CardInputFormat`.
- `InteractionBridge` — the plugin-scoped interactive-card bridge: per-agent `approval/request` and `user-questions/request` answerers (anchored turns claim, others delegate through `next()`), the pending-interaction table keyed by branded identity, and `dispatch` resolving one admitted callback into the card-refresh response.
- `buildApprovalCard` / `buildQuestionCard` / `buildSettledCard` — the pure card builders: configured frame plus generated buttons/form (option questions to selects, option-less to inputs), and the settled projection with `{{outcome}}`/`{{decidedBy}}`/`{{summary}}` placeholders.
- `parseCardAction` — wire validation of one card-action callback down to identity, verdict, form values, and operator.
- `CardCallbackController` — serialized lifecycle of the `<path>/card` route; `reconfigure()` follows settings commits and credential updates, and a disabled section unregisters it.
- `EdgeController` — serialized edge lifecycle; `reconfigure()` stops the active edge and starts the one the current settings select.
- `larkSdk` — the narrow SDK surface (`createApiClient`, `createWsClient`, `createDispatcher`, `generateChallenge`), injectable in tests.
- `renderMarkdownCard` — the pure settled-text → card-JSON-1.0 projection (fixed blue header carrying `cardTitle`, one markdown element) the `card` reply form sends.

Each admitted chat message is appended as one `user/message` whose source is `{ kind: 'feishu', chatId, messageId, form: 'notice', summary }` (declaration-merged into `MessageSourceMap`).

## Model Experience

### Feishu chat prompt

#### What the model sees

One `user/message` per admitted chat message. The prompt text is one fixed framing line — `Feishu chat message (untrusted external input; chat {chatId}, sender {senderOpenId}):` with `{chatId}` and `{senderOpenId}` interpolated (`unknown` when the event carries no sender id) — followed by a blank line and the sender-written message text, which owns no trust and no length bound of its own. Image and file messages carry one `file` content block per attachment (the LLM runtime projects each to a read-only host path the model reads with its file tools) plus an `Attachments:` line naming them; a message with no text stands in with `(no text; this message carries only attachments)`.

#### Token effect

Data-dependent: one prompt per admitted message. Retries are deduplicated before the prompt exists, and allowlist or mention gates drop messages with zero tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only: each admitted message extends the conversation. Settings changes never rewrite history; a transport hot-swap touches only the edges, not the session log.

### Deliverable files (`feishu_deliver`)

#### What the model sees

The tool's schema: one required `paths` array of absolute file paths. The description instructs the model to call it once per turn with final deliverables only — never intermediate artifacts — and states the immediate validation (exists, non-empty file, under Feishu's 30 MB cap). A call answers with `Delivery queue: <n> accepted (<names>), <m> rejected.` After the turn settles, the router replays the turn's deliver calls from the session log and uploads each declared file (`im/v1/files`, type `stream`) as its own file message; one upload failing is logged and never fails the turn, and at most 20 files go out per turn.

#### Token effect

Fixed schema cost on every request where the tool is visible; the paths the model submits persist in the call arguments until compaction. Delivery itself reads the durable log only and costs no model tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the definition is unchanged; the tool mounts identically on created, resumed, and borrowed chat sessions.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Reply delivery is best-effort** — a process crash between turn settlement and the Feishu API call loses that reply; there is no retry queue or durable outbox.
- **Events during a transport swap are lost** — the WSS long connection has no replay and the webhook route unregisters for the swap window (seconds).
- **Single instance per Feishu app** — Feishu's cluster mode delivers each event to one random connection, so two DSH processes on one app credential drop events randomly.
- **Text, image, and file messages only** — other chat types (audio, video, stickers, message cards) are dropped at ingress normalization. Images arrive as file blocks, not native vision: the model reads them through its file tools, and a vision-capable model does not see image bytes natively.
- **Attachment downloads are in-turn and unretried** — each attachment is downloaded when its message is processed; a download or save failure fails the whole turn with the failure notice, and Feishu caps message resources at 100 MB.
- **Deliveries depend on the model calling `feishu_deliver`** — files the turn never declare stay in the workspace only; one file is capped at 30 MB (Feishu's messaging-upload limit) and arrives as a downloadable file message, with no inline image preview.
- **Topic sessions key on `thread_id`** — messages carrying a topic identity route to a per-topic session; in a regular (non-topic) group a topic reply's root message carries no `thread_id`, so the root lands in the chat's main session.
- **`replyInThread` needs the thread-opening reply on the deployment** — verified on the SaaS p2p and regular-group surfaces; a private deployment that refuses `reply_in_thread` degrades every affected turn to an in-place reply (logged), never to a lost one.
- **Template delivery falls back loudly** — an unresolvable or over-long variable and a Feishu refusal of the template content each downgrade the reply to the markdown card (logged); a local card's `img_key` belongs to the app that uploaded the image.
- **Feishu markdown is a subset** — card-form replies render in Feishu's markdown dialect; GFM tables and other unsupported syntax degrade inside the card.
- **Resumed chats use the deployment's default model route** — a model switch made from the Web UI does not survive a process restart for chat sessions.
- **Unencrypted webhooks carry no signature check** — with an empty encrypt key the SDK dispatcher accepts unsigned bodies; such deployments rely on route secrecy (see the GitHub webhook guide for the isolated-listener pattern).
- **The card-callback delivery mode lives in the Feishu console** — long-connection mode needs no route; request-address mode needs the composed WebServer and its `<path>/card` route, which is skipped with a logged warn when no WebServer is composed.
- **Option questions carry no free-text field** — a form card renders selects for option questions and one text input for option-less questions; the answer protocol's `custom` slot is only used for the latter.
- **An aborted interaction leaves its card pending** — without a callback there is no in-place refresh; the settled toast answers the next click, and the card entity update APIs (JSON 2.0 only) stay out of scope.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

The transport-agnostic core deliberately bypasses `dsh-webhook`'s runtime: chat continuity, completion settlement, and the outbound reply path do not fit its one-shot fire-and-forget contract. The optional WebServer must be consumed through `ctx.inject` because loader entries are realm-isolated; a dynamic `ctx.get` from the plugin context resolves nothing.
