/**

 * validation: an approval click must carry a verdict and come from an
 * operator whose open id or user id a configured decider list names, so a
 * malformed or unqualified click leaves the pending claimable by a later
 * one. Callbacks must settle within Feishu's three-second response window,
 * so resolution only unblocks the waterfall; the agent's continued turn
